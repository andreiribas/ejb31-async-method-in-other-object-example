I posted a question on 

http://enthuware.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=2450

and they answered me, so I decided to create an example of the question.

This is the example where another bean calls the asynchronous method in a stateless session bean. The asynchonous method is a business method declared in the local interface.

It will work, the code will execute asynchronously.

To install in Eclipse, just run

mvn eclipse:eclipse 

Then import the project directory to your eclipse workspace.

To run on glassfish embedded server, just run

mvn clean package install

You can also run the unit tests on Eclipse, the result is the same.
